User: In triangle $ABC$, $AB$ is congruent to $AC$, the measure of angle $ABC$ is $72^{\circ}$ and segment $BD$ bisects angle $ABC$ with point $D$ on side $AC$. If point $E$ is on side $BC$ such that segment $DE$ is parallel to side $AB$, and point $F$ is on side $AC$ such that segment $EF$ is parallel to segment $BD$, how many isosceles triangles are in the figure shown?

User: A water tank can be filled by two pipes, one filling at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute and the other at a rate of 3 cubic meters per minute. However, due to a leak, the tank is losing water at a rate of 0.5 cubic meters per minute. If the tank takes 30 minutes to fill when both pipes are open, what is the capacity of the tank?

# Experiments

This folder contains experimental scripts and playground files for testing various quantization methods and model configurations.

## Contents

- **00_Playground.ipynb/py**: Sandbox for quick experiments and testing
- **create_1.5b_base.py**: Script to create 1.7B base model snapshots with optional quantized variants
- **run_quantization_experiments.py**: Master script to run complete quantization experiment pipeline
- **train_8b_qlora.py**: Standalone script for training Qwen3-8B with QLoRA
- **train_quantization_variants.py**: Script to train and save quantized model variants for comparison
- **QUANTIZATION_EXPERIMENTS.md**: Documentation on quantization experiments

## Usage

These scripts are for experimentation and may require configuration adjustments before running. Refer to the main project README for stable training pipelines.
